## Overview

###### What is this project?

You'll be building one more browser game, synthesizing all the knowledge you've packed into your brain over the past two weeks! You'll be leveraging the power of jQuery to create a **Racing Game**, where two players can move their "cars" across the browser to compete for the win.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we encourage you to get help from your peers and even pair-program on each other's projects when bugs arise.

## Topics Covered

###### What skills are we using?

By the time you submit this project, you will have leveled-up in many big themes in the course:

* **Terminal**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the file-system from the Command Line.
* **Git**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
* **JavaScript**: Work with objects and events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
* **Front-End**: Work on HTML structure, CSS styles, and animating documents within a browser. Also, learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
* **Documentation**: Document your code and your GitHub repository so others understand what you've built.
